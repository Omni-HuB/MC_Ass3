Q1

(a)
Write an app that collects data from the accelerometers and shows
in real-time the orientation of the smartphone (in terms of three angles).
Note that the phone need not be still when the app is actually run, so
the values may keep changing.
 
A second activity of the app is that it also
collects the orientation over time in a database.

and export the history as textfile 


, and then shows its history
in the form of three graphs. 





(b) 
Take the history as a text file on your desktop, and treat it as a time
series to predict the next 10s of values. Plot the predicted vs actual values
in this way. Now, change the sensing intervals to three other values, and
repeat the same process.
