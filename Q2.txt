Q2

2. While Android’s libraries provide a lot of functionalities, it does not pro-
vide any technique of running neural network in Kotlin. However, it has

a neural networks API for native code. Write a program that collects a
set of images, and runs any form of convolutional neural network on them
to classify them.



Grading Rubric

1. Running of basic native code – 10 marks

2. Utilization of Native Neural Networks API – 10 marks

3. Activity to load images (either from camera or from a file) – 10 marks
4. Running of the prediction (proper running and output is important, but
very high accuracy is not needed) – 10 marks
